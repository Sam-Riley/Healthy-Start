Nutrient,Description
Vitamin_A,"Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that's stored in the liver. Vitamin A is important for your baby's embryonic growth, including the development of the heart, lungs, kidneys, eyes, and bones as well as the circulatory, respiratory, and central nervous systems.Vitamin A is particularly essential for women who are about to give birth because it helps with postpartum tissue repair. It also helps maintain normal vision, fights infections, supports your immune system, and helps with fat metabolism."
Vitamin_B,"A lack of vitamin B6 has been linked with pregnancy nausea, so eat whole grains, potatoes, milk, cod, and bananas, which are all good sources."
Vitamin_C,Aids in iron absorption
Vitamin_D,"Helps your baby's bones develop healthily"
Vitamin_K,Helps with blood clotting
Folic_acid,"Helps to prevent birth defectsTake 400 mcg of folic acid daily to safeguard development of your baby's neural tube."
Iron,"Your body uses iron to make extra blood (hemoglobin) for you and your baby during pregnancy. Iron also helps move oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body -- and to your baby's. Getting enough iron can prevent a condition of too few red blood cells that can make you feel tired, called iron deficiency anemia."
Zinc,"A building block of life. Zinc, a mineral present in many foods, plays an essential role in the construction of your baby's cells and DNA during pregnancy. It is needed for cell division and tissue growth, supporting normal development as your baby grows"
Calcium,"Your body needs calcium to build and maintain strong bones. Your heart, muscles and nerves also need calcium to function properly. Some studies suggest that calcium, along with vitamin D, may have benefits beyond bone health, perhaps protecting against cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure."
Omega_3_Fatty_acids,Studies have also shown that higher consumption of omega-3s may reduce the risk of allergies in infants. Omega-3 fatty acids have positive effects on the pregnancy itself
Protein,"It's also common for women to develop gestational diabetes. Eating a diet rich in protein helps to stabilize blood sugar levels. Most importantly, the amino acids in protein are quite literally the building blocks of the human body. Proteins not only repair muscle tissue but also red blood cells"
Potassium,"During pregnancy, your body requires optimum amounts of potassium to function properly. The vital mineral helps maintain your bodyï¿½s fluid and electrolyte balance. Additionally, it plays a pivotal role in the contraction of your body muscles, transmission of nerve impulses, and release of energy from vital nutrients like fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Along with sodium, the presence of potassium regulates your healthy blood pressure level. A low degree of potassium during pregnancy can impose adverse effects and can lead to unwanted complexities."
